# My Plastic Pays

Have you ever wondered what happens to the plastic bottles you throw away? Well, it’s story isn’t appealing.Our addiction towards plastic bottles is resulting in gigantic heaps of plastic waste being generated every day.   Environmentally, plastic is a growing disaster. It is estimated that India generates 9.46 million tonnes of plastic waste annually out of which only 9% is being recycled. Animals consume it, get caught in it and all together destroy the ecosystem.
As a  citizen we are responsible for the waste   we produce.
Leaving to others to clean up the litter  we produce does not sit right. Finally, it all comes to the baby steps we can take to prevent this  pollution. 

## Our Intention

The segregation of plastic wastes is one of the major challenges we face right now. Even with the  proper availability  of dustbins, people still fail to use it. Majority of the time, these dumped waste ends up in landfills. To tackle this issue , we’ve come up with an innovative dustbin that rewards you for every plastic bottle or aluminium can you deposit in it.
This initiative will not only encourage the users to deposit plastic responsibly but also clean the environment and protect the ecosystem.

## How does our machine work?

   You can deposit the item only if the machine,GARBIN identifies it as plastic bottles or cans. It is done with the help of object detection using openCV.
After the item is identified, the respective vents open up and you can put the item in it. Then, you’ll get a slip (eco-friendly recycled paper) with QR code which when scanned will lead you to download an app and earn coins.
After earning more coins i.e., depositing more items, you’ll be able to redeem these rewards as vouchers or subscriptions .
Once it fills up, there is a provision inside the machine to crush the bottles to create extra space. 
If a single person deposits more than 10 bottles a day ,the rewardings reduces by half each time.


## App features

  After downloading MyPlasticPays,  all your progress and rewards are saved there. You can also locate the nearby bins in the app. Also, every month we honor the one who contributes the most in the collection of plastics.There is also a leaderboard to appreciate the most committed ones and  also a refer-and-earn method to encourage others to join in.

          

## What happens to the collected plastics/cans?

All these items are recycled . Since the materials are segregated using the machine, recycling becomes much easier.

## Conclusion

  Plastics made from recycled plastics need only two-third of production energy than that made from virgin sources. This way we make less plastic waste and a cleaner environment.
