## About The Project

### What's the problem?

Plastic disposal in public places with no convenient or cost-effective disposal methods leads to difficulty in segregation and makes recycling a hectic job for waste collectors.
Moreover, non biodegradable wastes harm the ecosystem affecting all organisms in the long run. Plastic waste also makes animal lives miserable.

### How can technology help?

We implement our model using AI and deep learning through OpenCv to identify the plastic bottles and cans making segregation easier.
MyPlasticPay app works as a bin tracker and rewarding channel through which you can contribute your part to the environment.

### The Idea

  It is essential that we have to preserve our surroundings for the well being of our future generations. With the help  of a set of  open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, our GARBIN machine paves an innovative and cost-effective way to deposit plastic wastes making segregation and recycling process a lot easier.

## Architecture

![Architecture](./docs/Architecture.jpg)
1. The user interacts with GARBIN(plastic depositing bin) and acquires a QR code. Scanning the QR code leads to the download of MyPlasticPays app.
2. Watson assistant - To build conversational flow between the app and the user.
3. IBM Cloudant- A NoSQL database to store the data of users.
4. IBM Code Engine - To run the app on a managed serverless platform.


## Long Description
